# telegram-counting-bot
That's the bot that gives you the estimated reading time based on a number of words you fed him. Everything is based on the data I collected (the example is in .csv file) and fancy ML algorithms.

You'll need graphlab and python Telegram API wrapper for this bot. You simply download the both .py and .csv file and fire it up.
